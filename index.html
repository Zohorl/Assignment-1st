            <p>Web Development - 2022. My passion is solving problems. I thrive when tasked with a challenge, and love
                digging into a problem to find the root cause. The web has been an exciting place in recent years, and
                I'm eager to continue learning it as more features are created and new ideas are formed.</p>

            <p>Web development is the process of designing, coding, testing and maintaining websites. As a web
                developer, your job is to make beautiful and user-friendly web experiences for others. You are in charge
                of showing the world who you are. You'd be surprised at what you can do with it.</p>

            <p>The scope of a web developer is different than that of a web designer: A web designer's work focuses on
                improving the visual appearance of a website, and creating an intuitive user interface. Web designers
                build the structure, stylesheets, and layout on which the server-side implementation will be based. That
                said, many web developers are also capable or utilizing web design software such as Adobe Photoshop,
                Macromedia Dreamweaver, or Microsoft FrontPage to build their HTML websites.</p>
